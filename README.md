We are building a digital world of freedom based on onchain assets and metaverse experiences. We will publish our works here as we make progress. Stay tuned at https://quark20.com and join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/Y7AwD7tpS9)

## Onchain metaverse assets (w. ARC builder save/load access):
- Nakamoto Matrix parcel collection (built on Bitmap, center Matrix City in Blocks Of Bitcoin): https://magiceden.us/ordinals/marketplace/nakamotomatrix
- Blocks Of Bitcoin collection (built on Uncommon Sats & Bitmap): https://magiceden.us/ordinals/marketplace/blocks
- Quark20 miner collection (self-custody crosschain $Q mining built on BTC and ETH using ECDSA SECP256K1, Xverse & MetaMask required): https://magiceden.us/ordinals/marketplace/quark20
- .runescape collection (where we started): https://magiceden.us/ordinals/marketplace/runescape

## Onchain qAI agent (Xverse & MetaMask required):
- crosschain qAI agent on Nakamoto Matrix BTC inscription: https://ordinals.com/content/4219ab554f208fffaaa76dff74bedd0d3f2a07609cd4c5cdd2ae948fd85d87e5i20
- crosschain qAI agent on Quark20 miner BTC inscription: https://ordinals.com/content/0e33e2b01e55a5f4f13902d2cd5871172fef0b49a0247e5a66fa611e7d4f7c66i0

## Metaverse experiences:
- Next Level on Blocks Of Bitcoin (web): https://nextlevel.blocksofbitcoin.xyz/
- Next Level on Nakamoto Matrix (Unreal Engine, preview only): https://x.com/runeape_sats/status/1881592734873759837

## Metaverse builder tool:
We are compatible with [MML](https://mml.io/), a XML-like 3D format for describing 3D assets. You can reuse MML in other MML projects (e.g., Yuga Labs' OtherSide). Build once, use it on web and Unreal Engine https://x.com/runeape_sats/status/1892582805072232707
- ARC builder https://arc.blocksofbitcoin.xyz/
- ARC store builder to turn your plot into a pre-sale ready website (in alpha testing)
- Discord qAI text-to-3D tools (see Discord channels)
- Twitter qAI text-to-??? (coming soon in mid April)

## Metaverse tools (open-source, MIT license):
- bitcoin-mcp extends AI utilities with accurate Bitcoin blockchain data based on MCP: https://github.com/runeape-sats/bitcoin-mcp
- unreal-mcp enables Claude Desktop to build and modify 3D scenes in Unreal Engine through natural language, representing an early step toward text-to-game-generation technology: https://github.com/runeape-sats/unreal-mcp
- mix & match MCP tools, you can build BTC 3D blocks in Unreal Engine: https://x.com/runeape_sats/status/1906928039092736032

## Twitch 
livestream for Nakamoto Matrix (in development): https://www.twitch.tv/nakamotomatrix

## Quantum & ECDSA:
- A Quantum Solution to SECP256K1 Elliptic Curve Cryptography Using Shorâ€™s Algorithm: https://github.com/runeape-sats/shor-secp256k1
- Solving Discrete Logarithm Problems in ECDH Using Qiskit (sample code for running on quantum cloud services): https://github.com/runeape-sats/shor-ecdh

## qAI
metaverse AI agent (SOL): [ERKbvKU1Md4AXNyzWQbagRJWpGE7rwUxGep9ESaxpump](https://dexscreener.com/solana/9nhezuhqvat7vhktdwteguh9xryndeqhmvyvjfr7kpsz) (verified via [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/qai))
